and June revenue saw a -10.68% decrease from May, which is a cause of concern.
The product category "Set" dominates the revenue, accounting for 49.88% of total revenue, 
followed by "Kurta" with 27.09% and "Western Dress" with 14.28%.
The top 5 product categories by average price in dollars are "Set" ($9.43), "Saree" ($9.14),

The total number of cancelled and returned orders was 49,178, representing 17.53% of all orders.
